I tasked myself with making a quick coming soon message, incase a new domain is bought and nothing is connected up to it (wordpress etc)
<br>
I made it nice and simple, only using 3 files:

- index.html
- style.css
- Font: [Oxanium, via Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oxanium)

I've never made a "responsive" site so I used this as a test so it can work on any device and keeping the text aligned centered and in the centre of the screen. To increase speed, I also saved the font file to the same place, instead of it dowloading from google's system (This also fixed a issue of the text changing during load)

*To do...*

- Add small text block at bottom-left of the screen for extra information (email/link)
